===============================================================================

Version 3.4.7

Mostly fixes for DFD and other data compilers.

All data compilers and schema changes:
* Updated database minor version to 18 to reflect changes.
* Fixed issue with duplicate waypoints in airways for DFD, X-Plane and FSX/P3D compiler causing
  defects in airway network. Examples: MY/EK and SYA/PA. #516
* Added flag "artificial" for NDB and VOR waypoints which are created to simplify
  airway construction. Useful for debugging or future versions. #516

DFD:
* Updated DFD compiler to create new and separate UIR FIR airspace types besides the old
  deprecated center with "(FIR)" or "(UIR)" in the name. These new types will be used by the next
  Little Navmap version. Current versions 2.4.X are compatible with this change and show
  the old centers. #462
* Fixed issue where runway ends with more than one ILS had all except one detached from runway.
  Example: EDDF RWY25R ILSZ IFNW. #532
* Coordinates for fix and recommended fix in procedure tables added. Used for better navaid
  resolution in next Little Navmap version. #205

X-Plane:
* Improved removal of "[X]" prefixes in X-Plane and fixed issue where military airports were not
  detected in all cases.
* Changed airport ident to ICAO code for X-Plane compiler now. XP internal ids are now avoided
  except in duplicates. Added xpident to airport table which keeps the internal ID for
  X-Plane airports. #448
* Added runway smoothness and airport flatten flags from X-Plane to database schema.
* Corrected navaid range calculation for X-Plane. 125 NM is now treated as unpublished.

P3D:
